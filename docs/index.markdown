LatexConceptMapis a tool to create and view interactive graphs of concepts from a Latex file.


## Why use LatexConceptMap?

* For lecture notes: it is often hard for students to grasp the dependency structure. This allows seing what depends on what, and sometimes more importantly, what does not depend on what.

* For books: when you need a result from a book, it allows to read only the relevant parts and see what this result depends on in a single glance.

* For research papers: convoluted proofs can be hard to follow. This tool help clarifying those.


## Created from tex file

You can use existing Latex documents and add annotations.

## Published as a (static) website

The resulting graph can be simply published on a website by simply copying files to your website.
